# TODOs

In the test file everything.pptx, there are some issues still to be fixed:

- The background image is not being extracted.
- ~~There are many math symbols that are not being read~~ -> Fixed
- ~~Sometimes math text does not get converted to the latex command, and the actual greek symbol remains in the text. Fortunately, they do not crash python-pptx.~~ -> Fixed
- The table is not being converted.
- Shapes are not being converted.
